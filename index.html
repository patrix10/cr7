    A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[440] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[441] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[442][443] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[444] he has also been known to use the flip-flap

   <p>Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003-04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[33] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[34] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[35] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[36] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."</p>
   <p>Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4-0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[38] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[32] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3-0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[39] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[40] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.</p>
